Hello There Im KingSurge.

This repository will guide you on how to make your own Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

**Important Things To Note And Do:**

1. Each section of the code has comments to make it easier to understand.

2. For you to get through this it is required that you at least know the fundamentals of Python.

3. These files will still be updated from time to time, meaning they are still in development

4. You will need to know at least the fundamentals of Tkinter.

5. For this IDE to work you must have Python Installed on your device

6. Not designed for heavy projects - being worked on

7. Copy and paste from main file to Python Surge - IDE then save file _**(Outside Project Directory)**_ and run as a test this should create a duplicate of the ide proving it works

_**Please Note:**_

For the moment There will only be light theme due to syntax highlighting issues. I am currently working on these issues.
until then please enjoy light theme

Enjoy Python Surge!!
